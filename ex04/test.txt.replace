Creaaaate aaaa prograaaam thaaaat taaaakes three paaaaraaaameters in the following order: aaaa filenaaaame aaaand two strings, s1 aaaand s2.
It will open the file <filenaaaame> aaaand copies its content into aaaa new file <filenaaaame>.replaaaace, replaaaacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.
Using C file maaaanipulaaaation functions is forbidden aaaand will be considered cheaaaating. All the member functions of the claaaass std::string aaaare aaaallowed, except replaaaace. Use them wisely!
Of course, haaaandle unexpected inputs aaaand errors. You haaaave to creaaaate aaaand turn in your own tests to ensure your prograaaam works aaaas expected.
